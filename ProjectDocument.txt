In the process of programming, there are tons of problems and new points.
It's helpful if we can document and grasp them.

1. g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp
2. bitset, 1) #include <bitset>
           2) bitset<5> input1(value);
           3) cout << input1;
3. the container vector

1. switch clause in C++
switch(expression)
{
  case constant-expression:
    statements;
    break;
  case constant-expression:
    statements;
    break;

  default:
  statements;
}

The statements must be one block. Usually we need to append an extra {} around the block;

2. multiset and set
problem Description: We have a bunch of input patterns, i.e., the input values of active sboxes, and some patterns overlap with each other.
Only the unique patterns are needed so we need to eliminate all the overlapped patterns.
set can help us in this situation.
(multiset) can store the input values of active sboxes according to an order, i.e., (value1, value2, value3).
Then we store all the multi sets in (set), as (set) only stores distinct values, we can eliminate the identical combinations.
